    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>You are after an organised crime group which is responsible for the illegal weapon market in your country. As a
       secret agent, you have infiltrated the group enough to be included in meetings with clients. During the last 
       negotiation, you found one of the confidential messages for the customer. It contains crucial information about
       the delivery. Do you think you can decrypt it?</p>

    <h3>Task files:</h3>
    <p>1. chall.py</p>

    <pre>
        <code class="language-python">
import string
from secret import MSG

def encryption(msg):
    ct = []
    for char in msg:
        ct.append((123 * char + 18) % 256)
    return bytes(ct)

ct = encryption(MSG)
f = open('./msg.enc','w')
f.write(ct.hex())
f.close()
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>2. msg.enc</p>

    <pre>
        <code class="language-console">

        </code>
    </pre>
    
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>We receive 2 files: an encryption script ('chall.py') and an encrypted key ('msg.enc'). When attempting to run
       the Python script, we encounter the following error:</p>

    <pre>
        <code class="language-console">
Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "chall.py", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
        from secret import MSG
ImportError: cannot import name 'MSG' from 'secret'
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>We don't need to run the script because it's enough to understand how the message was encrypted and then 
       everse engineer it. The script processes each character of the message and applies some arithmetic operations to it.
       Since you can't directly add a character to a number, we can assume that each character was first converted into 
       its ASCII equivalent, which was then copied into a new list. After that, the list was converted into bytes and then 
       to hex format. With this understanding of how the message was encrypted, we can now write another Python script 
       to decrypt it.</p>

       <pre>
        <code class="language-python">
f = open("msg.enc", "r")
msg = f.read()
byte_msg = bytes.fromhex(msg)
decrypted_msg = ""
for char in byte_msg:
        for i in range(256):
                if char == ((123*i + 18) % 256):
                        decrypted_msg += chr(i)
                        break

print(decrypted_msg)
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>First, we convert the message from hex back to binary format. Then, we iterate through each byte, converting it
       to an integer value. For each integer, we iterate through possible ASCII values, applying the encryption's 
       arithmetic operations to determine if we can reverse them to find the original ASCII value. Once we identify the
       correct value, we append the corresponding character to a string. Finally, we print the resulting string. The output
       will be as follows:</p>

    <pre>
        <code class="language-python">
Th3 nucl34r w1ll 4rr1v3 0n fr1d4y.

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>After struggling to secure our secret strings for a long time, we finally figured out the solution to our problem: 
       Make decompilation harder. It should now be impossible to figure out how our programs work!</p>
